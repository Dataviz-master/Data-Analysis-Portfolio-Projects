# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis | Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** built using **Power BI Desktop**.  
The dashboard analyzes **current year (CY) vs previous year (PY)** accident and casualty trends to uncover key insights related to **vehicle type, road conditions, lighting, location, and time**.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate **data analysis, DAX, and dashboard storytelling skills** using real-world public safety data.
